## Current test state

Passing:

- dedicated module tests;
- `npm run apex:quick`;
- TypeScript typecheck.

## Current task

Offline Cache Synchronization Integration

The IndexedDB Offline Cache adapter is complete and verified.

Completed work now includes:

- all previously completed Offline Cache foundations;
- deliberate selection of `idb` for browser and PWA persistence;
- `fake-indexeddb` for automated adapter verification;
- IndexedDB database creation and deletion boundaries;
- an Offline Cache object store keyed by entry id;
- compound ownership/sequence and ownership/status/sequence indexes;
- IndexedDB row mapping with defensive cloning;
- `getById`;
- atomic `insert`;
- protected `update`;
- `getHighestSequence`;
- ownership- and status-scoped `list`;
- deterministic ordering across all selected statuses;
- global limit application after ordering;
- duplicate-key and missing-update verification;
- user and device isolation;
- the full shared storage-conformance suite passing against IndexedDB;
- expanded focused Offline Cache verification.

The next focused checkpoint prepares and implements the native SQLite adapter
against the same storage, migration, and conformance foundations.

## Next tasks

1. Native SQLite Offline Cache adapter
2. Event Analytics
3. Memory Consolidation Engine
4. Autonomous Learning Engine

## Known issues

None currently recorded.

## Important instruction

Do not shorten the product roadmap into AI-only stages. Preserve PvP, Bloodlines, accessibility, Recovery Pause, injury adaptation, equipment intelligence, social systems, devices, and release stages.

## Completed workout lifecycle checkpoint

Workout Lifecycle Stabilisation was completed, verified, committed, and
pushed in:

`08e884d — Stabilise workout lifecycle and execution`

It remains a stable prerequisite for synchronized workout evidence.

## Architecture continuity

Cloud Sync Contracts, Cloud Sync Repository, and Cloud Sync Service are
complete.

The active Stage 6 milestone is Offline Cache Synchronization Integration.

Offline Cache must extend the existing sync architecture rather than create a
second queue, competing checkpoint model, or alternative source of truth.

## Product-identity clarification

The Apex North Star has been expanded and documented.

Apex is intended to become an intelligent lifestyle companion, not only a
fitness coach.

The following future intelligence arc has been captured without changing the
active milestone:

1. Adaptive Coach Intelligence
2. Lifestyle Intelligence
3. Companion Intelligence
4. Long-Term Life Intelligence

The current engineering task is Offline Cache Synchronization Integration.

These ideas are documented now and implemented only when their foundations,
evidence, safety controls, privacy boundaries, and roadmap dependencies are
ready.
