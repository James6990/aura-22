## Current test state

Passing:

- dedicated module tests;
- `npm run apex:quick`;
- TypeScript typecheck.

## Current task

Offline Cache Synchronization Integration

The first Offline Cache foundation checkpoint is complete and verified.

Completed foundation work:

- versioned cache-entry contracts;
- local and remote origin tracking;
- staged, applied, conflicted, and invalid lifecycle states;
- runtime schema and ownership validation;
- deterministic ordering;
- idempotent persistence;
- platform-neutral storage port;
- explicit conflict details;
- validated lifecycle transitions;
- storage-adapter response safeguards;
- dedicated contract and repository tests;
- `apex:offline-cache:quick` and `apex:offline-cache` commands.

The next focused checkpoint connects this foundation to the existing Cloud
Sync upload and download services without duplicating their outbox or
checkpoint lifecycle.

## Next tasks

1. Local-envelope staging into the Offline Cache
2. Deterministic remote-envelope cache application
3. Cache-to-Cloud-Sync repository integration
4. Conflict mapping and safe retry boundaries
5. Platform adapter planning for IndexedDB and SQLite
6. Event Analytics
7. Memory Consolidation Engine
8. Autonomous Learning Engine

## Known issues

None currently recorded.

## Important instruction

Do not shorten the product roadmap into AI-only stages. Preserve PvP, Bloodlines, accessibility, Recovery Pause, injury adaptation, equipment intelligence, social systems, devices, and release stages.

## Completed workout lifecycle checkpoint

Workout Lifecycle Stabilisation was completed, verified, committed, and
pushed in:

`08e884d — Stabilise workout lifecycle and execution`

It remains a stable prerequisite for synchronized workout evidence.

## Architecture continuity

Cloud Sync Contracts, Cloud Sync Repository, and Cloud Sync Service are
complete.

The active Stage 6 milestone is Offline Cache Synchronization Integration.

Offline Cache must extend the existing sync architecture rather than create a
second queue, competing checkpoint model, or alternative source of truth.

## Product-identity clarification

The Apex North Star has been expanded and documented.

Apex is intended to become an intelligent lifestyle companion, not only a
fitness coach.

The following future intelligence arc has been captured without changing the
active milestone:

1. Adaptive Coach Intelligence
2. Lifestyle Intelligence
3. Companion Intelligence
4. Long-Term Life Intelligence

The current engineering task is Offline Cache Synchronization Integration.

These ideas are documented now and implemented only when their foundations,
evidence, safety controls, privacy boundaries, and roadmap dependencies are
ready.
